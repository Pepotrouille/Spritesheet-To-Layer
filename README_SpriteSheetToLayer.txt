------------What does the script do?

It converts one cel spritesheet into the right amont of layers and frames. It can help you to:
 - Import spritesheet using layers easily
 - Export a grid of elements into single elements png files with well organised names using layer names, with for instance 
   the following script from GASPI https://github.com/PKGaspi/AsepriteScripts/blob/main/scripts/gaspi/export_layers.lua
   You can see an example of it through my Fantasy Items pack 16x16 on my Itch.io

------------Installation

To use, take the .lua file from the archive and put it in your [Aseprite's user script folder](https://community.aseprite.org/t/locate-user-scripts-folder/2170).

------------How to use

The Script window will ask you the size of the final cel, width and height (16x16, 64x64...)
You will also see two other option, 
 - The first one is two turn on/off the visibility of all layers after the script
 - The second one will ask if the layer on front/ont top is the layer located on the top or bottom of your current spritesheet.

Finally, I recommend you to save it in a different file so you keep your spritesheet
